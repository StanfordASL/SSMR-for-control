%                          MATRIX EXPONENT
%
% This function build the indeces matrix for a multivariate polynomial of n
% variables and N degree (the two inputs). The vector nterms
% contain the number of possible indeces unique combinations (comibinations
% with repetitions) that are:
%
%      nterms=factorial(n+N-1)/factorial(N)/factorial(n-1)
%
% The matrix Mi contains all the unique combinations of exponents of the
% polynomial variables up at the desired order N.
%
% The used method is the following. At the order N, the following equation
% must be valid:
%
%                 e1 + e2 + ... + en = N   (1)
%
% where ej are the exponents for all the n variables that can be integers
% or zero. Thus, first the ordered unique solutions to this equations are
% found by menas of the function expomatr. This is a recursive function
% that generate a matrix em containing the solutions of the following:
%
%                 e1 + e2 + ... + eN = N   (2)
%                 e1>=e2>=e3>=....>=eN
%
% Then this matrix is either kept (N=n) or completed with zeros (N<n) or
% properly cutted in the desired way for (N>n) generating the matrix sols.
% For instance if N=3:
%
%                 em=[3 0 0; 2 1 0; 1 1 1]
%
% n=4 -->         sols=[3 0 0 0; 2 1 0 0; 1 1 1 0]
% n=3 -->         sols=em                                (3)
% n=2 -->         sols=[3 0; 2 1]
%
% This matrix sols represents the unique solutions of problem (1) with the
% coefficients satisfying the constaint: e1>=e2>=e3>=....>=en . From here,
% the constraint is taken away and so the solutions to equation (1) are the
% non-repeating permutations of each line of the matrix sols in (3) that
% are all collected in the matrix Mi. E.g. N=3, n=2
%
%                   Mi=[3 0; 0 3; 2 1; 1 2]
%
% The real bottleneck...
% of the algorithm is the permutation procedure. Still, a fast algorithm
% considering the repetitions in a smart way is not available. We can avoid
% the use of perms with several variables (it is inefficient with more than
% 10 variables) by using the combinations of indexes as done for the case
% of N<n.

% PERMUTATIONS WITHOUT REPETITIONS
% Given a set of numbers in v, this code returns all the possible permuta-
% tions without repeating ones. Given that the length of vector v is n, all
% the possible permutations are n! in number and they are contained in the
% matrix P. This is computed with the matlab functions perms (that handles
% well up to n=10). If in v there are nr repeating terms i=1,...r each of
% them repeating ki times, the number of all possible permutations without
% repetitions is n!/k1!/k2!.../kr! and they are all saved in the output
% matrix PnR. These are obtained by properly sorting the matrix P coming
% out perms, evaluating the denominator k1!*k2!*...*kr! by examining the
% vector v and in the end taking 1 row of P every k1!*k2!*...*kr! ones.
