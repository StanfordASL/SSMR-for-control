[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4614201.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4614201)

This package computes invariant manifolds in high-dimensional dynamical systems using the *Parametrization Method* with special attention to the computation of Spectral Submanifolds (SSM) and forced response curves in finite element models.

These invariant manifolds are computed in the physical coordinates using only the master modes resulting in efficient and feasible computations for high-dimensional finite-element problems. Additionally, the user has an option to choose among the graph or normal form style of parametrization. The computational methodology is described in the following article:

The theoretical and computational aspects for analyzing systems with internal resonances via multi-dimensional SSMs are given in the following articles:

In this version, we demonstrate the computational methodology over the following small academic examples as well high-dimensional finite element problems using the FE package [4]

- Complex Dyn: example of 4D first-order dynamical system with complex coefficients benchmarked against SSMTool 1.0.
- Oscillator chain: two coupled oscillators with 1:2 internal resonance, three coupled oscillators with 1:1:1 internal resonance and n coupled oscillators without any internal resonances.
- Bernoulli beam: modeled using linear finite elements with localized nonlinearity in the form of a cubic spring with and without 1:3 **internal resonances** (IR) and demonstration of bifurcation to quasiperiodic response on a 3D torus.
- von Karman straight beam in 2D: geometrically nonlinear finite element model with and without internal resonance (1:3) and demonstration of bifurcation to quasiperiodic response on a 2D torus.
- von Karman plate in 3D: geometrically nonlinear finite element model of a square flat plate with demonstration of **parallel computing**, 1:1 internal resonance and bifurcation to quasiperiodic response on a 2D torus.
- von Karman shell-based shallow curved panel in 3D: geometrically nonlinear finite element model.
- Prismatic beam: nonlinear beam PDE discretized using Galerkin method onto a given number of modes, comparison with the method of multiple scales, demonstration of 1:3 internal internal resonance
