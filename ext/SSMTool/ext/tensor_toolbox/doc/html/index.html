      <h2 id="functionality">Functionality</h2>
      

      <p>The Tensor Toolbox provides the classes and
	functions for manipulating dense, sparse, and structured
	tensors using MATLAB's object-oriented features. This
	documention is provided via the MATLAB help interface under
	"Supplemental Software".</p>

      <ul>
	<li><a href="tensor_types.html">Tensor Types</a> - The Tensor
	Toolbox supports multiple tensor types, including dense,
	sparse, and symmetric tensors as well as specially structured
	tensors, such as Tucker format (core tensor plus factor
	matrices), Krusal format (stored as factor matrices), sum
	format (sum of differnt types of tensors such as sparse plus
	rank-1 tensor in Kruskal format), and so.</li>
	<li><a href="converting.html">Converting Tensors and
	Matrices</a> - The Tensor Toolbox includes special matrix
	classes to enable conversion to/from tensors.</li>
	<li><a href="working.html">Working with Tensors</a> - Creating
	test problems, tensor multiplication, and more.
	<li><a href="cp.html">CP Decompositions</a> - CP methods such
	  as alternating least squares, direct optimization, and
	  weighted optimization (for missing data). Also alternative
	  decompositions such as Poisson Tensor Factorization via
	  alternating Poisson regression and symmetric CP tensor
	  factorization.
	<li><a href="tucker.html">Tucker Decomposition</a> - Tucker
	  methods including as the higher-order SVD (HOSVD), the
	  sequentially-truncated HOSVD (ST-HOSVD), and the
	  higher-order orthognal interation (HOOI).</li>
	<li><a href="eigen.html">Eigenproblems</a> - Methods to solve
	the tensor eigenproblem including the shifted higher-order
	power method (SSHOPM) and the adaptive shift version (GEAP).

      <p>Tensor Toolbox requires a recent version of MATLAB to operate properly.
	We try to maintain backwards compatibility but cannot guarantee it.      
	To obtain an official release, visit the
	<a href="https://gitlab.com/tensors/tensor_toolbox/releases">Releases</a> page.
	To work with the latest development version, please clone from
	<a href="http://gitlab.com/tensors/tensor_toolbox">GITLAB</a>.
	Once you have downloaded or cloned the toolbox,
	simply add <tt>tensor_toolbox</tt> to your path and
	type <tt>help tensor_toolbox</tt> to get started.</p>

      <p>This is open source software. Please see

      <h2 id="how-to-cite">How to Cite</h2>
      
      <p>Because it helps us to show the relevance of this work, if
	you use the Tensor Toolbox in your work in any way, please
	cite the software itself along with at least one publication
	or preprint.  The help and documentation will generally
	suggest the appropriate reference, but the three primary
	references are given below.  We
	provide <a href="bibtex.html">BibTeX source</a> for each
	suggested citation.  Thanks very much for your support.</p>
