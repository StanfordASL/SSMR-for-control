# MATLAB Tensor Toolbox, Version 3.1

Tensors (also known as multidimensional arrays or N-way arrays) are used in a 
variety of applications ranging from chemometrics to network analysis. 
The Tensor Toolbox provides the following classes for manipulating dense, 
sparse, and structured tensors using MATLAB's object-oriented features:

* `tensor` - Dense tensors, extending MATLAB's native mutlidimensional array capabilities.
* `sptensor` - Sparse tensors, only stores the nonzeros and their indices.
* `symtensor` - Symmetric tensor, only stores the unique entries.
* `ttensor` - Tucker decomposed tensor, stored as a core and factor matrices.
* `ktensor` - Kruskal decomposed tensor, stored as weight and factor matrices.
* `symktensor` - Kruskal decomposed _symmetric_ tensor, stored as weight and factor matrix.
* `sumtensor` - Sum of different types of tensors, never formed explicitly.
* `tenmat` - Tensor as a matrix, with extra information so that it can be converted back into a tensor.
* `sptenmat` - Store an sptensor as a sparse matrix in coordinate format, with extra information so that it can be converted back into an sptensor.

The Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB is open source, but we ask that you please cite 
the appropriate references ([listed below](#how-to-cite)) so that we can continue to show the 
relevance of this work. Your contributions are warmly welcomed as well; please 
see the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md).

### What's new in Version 3.0?

Version 3.0 adds

* New classes and functions for symmetric tensors: `symtensor`, `symktensor`, `cp_sym`
* New class for sums of different tensor types: `sumtensor`
* Function to compute HOSVD and ST-HOSVD: `hosvd`

We have also fixed many bugs. View the [RELEASE_NOTES.txt](RELEASE_NOTES.txt) file for details.
